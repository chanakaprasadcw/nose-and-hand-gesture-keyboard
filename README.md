# Nose and Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Keyboard

This project implements a virtual keyboard that can be controlled using nose gestures for selecting keys and right-hand gestures for pressing them. Utilizing Mediapipe for face and hand tracking, this innovative solution allows for hands-free typing, which can be particularly useful for individuals with limited mobility or for touchless interactions in hygienic environments.

## Features

- **Nose Gesture Selection**: Use your nose to hover over and select keys on the virtual keyboard.
- **Right Hand Gesture Press**: Use the index finger of your right hand to press the selected key.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The virtual keyboard provides real-time visual feedback, highlighting selected keys.
- **Touchless Typing**: Enables hands-free typing, ideal for accessibility and hygienic use cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Mediapipe
- OpenCV
- Pyperclip
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nose-and-hand-gesture-keyboard.git
   cd nose-and-hand-gesture-keyboard
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python nose_hand_gesture_keyboard.py
   ```

2. **Interacting with the Keyboard**:
   - **Select a Key**: Move your nose over the desired key on the virtual keyboard to select it. The key will be highlighted.
   - **Press the Key**: Raise the index finger of your right hand to press the selected key. The typed word will appear below the keyboard.
   - **Copy Text**: Press the "COPY" button to copy the typed text to the clipboard.

3. **Exit the Application**: Press the 'q' key to exit the application.
