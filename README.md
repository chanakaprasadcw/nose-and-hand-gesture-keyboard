# Nose and Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Keyboard

This project implements a virtual keyboard that can be controlled using nose gestures for selecting keys and right-hand gestures for pressing them. Utilizing Mediapipe for face and hand tracking, this innovative solution allows for hands-free typing, which can be particularly useful for individuals with limited mobility or for touchless interactions in hygienic environments.

## Features

- **Nose Gesture Selection**: Use your nose to hover over and select keys on the virtual keyboard.
- **Right Hand Gesture Press**: Use the index finger of your right hand to press the selected key.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The virtual keyboard provides real-time visual feedback, highlighting selected keys.
- **Touchless Typing**: Enables hands-free typing, ideal for accessibility and hygienic use cases.
